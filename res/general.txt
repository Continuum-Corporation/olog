### Instructions for Language System: Modeling Ologs in JSON

When representing ologs as JSON structures, it's crucial to precisely define and differentiate between the fundamental components: TYPES, ASPECTS, and INSTANCES. The JSON structure should be designed to facilitate ease of extension, graph computations, inter-olog connections, and straightforward interpretation. Here are detailed instructions for each component:

#### TYPES
1. **Definition**: Each type represents a class of entities or concepts. Types should be uniquely identifiable and named using clear, singular indefinite noun phrases.
2. **Structure**: In JSON, a type can be represented as an object with a unique ID, a descriptive name, and optionally, metadata providing additional context or details.
3. **Uniqueness**: Ensure each type has a unique identifier to avoid confusion and facilitate references in aspects and facts.

#### ASPECTS
1. **Definition**: Aspects are directed relationships or properties that connect two types, representing functional relationships.
2. **Structure**: Represent an aspect as an object with its own ID, containing references to its source and target types, and a label describing the relationship.
3. **Functional Relationship**: Emphasize that each aspect must depict a one-to-one correspondence between instances of the source and target types.

#### INSTANCES
1. **Definition**: Instances are specific examples or occurrences of types, adhering to the constraints and relationships defined by the aspects.
2. **Structure**: Represent instances as a list or set associated with their respective type. Each instance can have its own ID and attributes that align with the aspects of its type.
3. **Differentiation from Facts**: Distinguish clearly between instances and facts. Instances are concrete examples of types, whereas facts are abstract equivalences between paths in the olog.

#### General Guidelines
1. **Extensibility**: Design the JSON structure to be easily extendable, allowing for the addition of new types, aspects, and instances without restructuring the entire model.
2. **Graph Computations**: Facilitate graph-related computations by ensuring that types and aspects can be easily traversed and queried.
3. **Inter-Olog Connections**: Enable linking between different ologs by allowing types and aspects in one olog to reference those in another, fostering interconnected knowledge systems.
4. **Interpretability**: Strive for clarity and simplicity in the JSON representation, making it intuitive for both humans and machines to interpret the olog's structure and content.

By adhering to these instructions, the language system will be well-equipped to model ologs in a JSON format effectively, maintaining the integrity and utility of the ological framework.
