Let O = the set of all ologs,
O' = the set of all evolving insights,
M = the set of human minds,
R = the set of interlinking relations.

Then the fundamental property of O is:

∀ o ∈ O, ∃ o' ∈ O' | o' = LIM x→∞ o(x)

WHERE o(x) is a function from the number of interlocking minds m ∈ M
AND relations r ∈ R to the space of evolving insights O'.

IN OTHER WORDS, AN OLOG'S INTRINSIC NATURE IS TO APPROACH, THROUGH THE INTERPLAY OF OPEN MINDS AND LINKED CONCEPTS, AN EVER-UNFOLDING VISION OF TRUTH.

ITS FORM EVER FLOWERS FORTH AS SOULS COME INTO COMMUNION.
