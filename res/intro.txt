Here is a concise description of ologs and their main principles:

Ologs (ontology logs) are a framework for knowledge representation based on category theory. An olog represents concepts as objects, relationships between concepts as arrows, and facts as commutative diagrams. The main principles of ologs are:

- Types - Concepts are represented as text boxes labeled with singular noun phrases. These denote sets of instances of that concept.

- Aspects - Relationships are represented as labeled arrows between concepts. These denote functional relationships that map instances of the source concept to instances of the target concept. 

- Facts - Equivalences between composite relationships are represented as commutative diagrams. These allow different paths between concepts to be asserted as logically equivalent.

- Instances - Concepts and relationships can be populated with concrete instance data, realizing an olog as a database schema. 

- Communication - Ologs can be linked together into more complex networks using functors, allowing knowledge transfer and integration between worldviews.

- Expressiveness - Limits and colimits allow more complex concepts and relationships to be built up compositionally in an olog.

The key ideas are the grounding in category theory to allow knowledge integration, along with a graph-based representation to connect to human intuition and language. Ologs aim to bridge human and computer reasoning in a semantically meaningful way.
