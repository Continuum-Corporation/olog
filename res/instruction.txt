### Detailed Guidelines for Language Models Creating Types and Aspects in Ologs

#### Types

1. **Use Singular and Indefinite Forms**: Always phrase a type as a singular indefinite noun phrase (e.g., "a car", not "cars" or "the car"). This helps in generalizing the type to represent a class of entities.

2. **Focus on Intent, Not Instances**: Define types by their conceptual essence rather than listing examples. This approach allows for a broader and more flexible understanding of the type.

3. **Ensure Readability in Text Integration**: When types are embedded in text, use concise and clear symbolic representations to maintain flow and readability.

4. **Transforming Mass and Proper Nouns**: Convert mass nouns into countable forms using units or standard measures. Generalize proper nouns into a class (e.g., "a person named John" instead of "John").

5. **Handle Singletons with Caution**: Avoid creating types that represent single, indivisible entities. If necessary, present them as classes that can potentially include multiple instances or interpretations.

6. **Clarify Compound Structures**: In types representing compound structures, explicitly declare all constituent elements and their relationships to prevent confusion.

7. **Make Implicit Assumptions Explicit**: For types that might carry implicit assumptions (like uniqueness or exclusivity), explicitly state these assumptions in the typeâ€™s definition.

8. **Adaptable Representation**: Be flexible in representing types, using nicknames or abbreviations where appropriate, but without sacrificing clarity or accuracy.

9. **Define Well-Delineated Sets**: Types should represent clearly defined and distinguishable sets of entities, as perceived by the creator of the olog.

10. **Uniform Labeling Approach**: Adopt a consistent labeling scheme for types throughout the olog to aid in coherence and comprehension.

#### Aspects

1. **Represent Functional Relationships Only**: Ensure aspects represent functional relationships where each source instance uniquely determines a target instance. Avoid relationships that are ambiguous or multi-valued.

2. **Start Labels with Verbs**: Aspect labels should begin with a verb to clearly indicate the action or relation (e.g., "has", "contains", "is").

3. **Construct Coherent Sentences**: The combination of source type, aspect label, and target type should form a meaningful and grammatically correct sentence.

4. **Enforce One-to-One Mapping**: Each instance in the source type should correspond to exactly one instance in the target type, maintaining the functional nature of the aspect.

5. **Reformulate Non-functional Relationships**: For non-functional relations, consider rephrasing them into functional aspects or representing them using sets and Cartesian products.

6. **Explicitly Depict Relations**: Clearly represent the elements and connections in a relation, particularly when it involves complex or compound structures.

7. **Adapt to Context**: Tailor aspect labels and representations to fit the specific context, ensuring they accurately convey the intended meaning.

8. **Utilize Graphs for Complex Functions**: For multifaceted or intricate functional relationships, use graphical representations to aid in clarity and understanding.

9. **Consistency in Structure and Labeling**: Maintain a uniform approach in structuring and labeling aspects throughout the olog for consistency and ease of interpretation.

10. **Clear Path Narratives**: When constructing paths through an olog, use transitional phrases like "which leads to" or "resulting in" to ensure clarity and logical flow in the narrative.
